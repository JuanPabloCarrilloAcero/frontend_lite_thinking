Frontend Coding Challenge - README

This frontend application is developed to complement the backend 
system described in the coding challenge. It is built using modern
frontend technologies and follows a structured approach with components,
constants, methods, models, services, and utility functions.

Below is a comprehensive guide to the frontend application:

Empresa (Company) View:

    Display information about companies including NIT, name, address, and contact details.
